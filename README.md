# The Girl Code Platform overview

The Girl Code Platform is a powerful, open source application which is used in our workshops to teach programming. At The Girl Code, we aim to inspire young girls that they can code too. By teaching them Python through fun and interactive media and exposing them to a community of likeminded young girls. We're a small team of 10 developers at the moment trying to make the introduction to programming as magical as possible.
