      <h1> Lists&middot; Python</h1>

      <p>
       Eve wants to go grocery shopping, so, she makes a list of all the items she  needs. Her list contains the following items: <br> 
      <ul>
      <li>Butter </li>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Chocolate </li>
      <li>Carrots </li>
      </ul>   

      <p>

      Python offers a tool called lists to keep track of related "things," or values which are similar.<br>
      To help Eve, let's make a list called shopping_list  and fill it with each of the items:<br><br>

      <!-- Hello01234 image -->
      <center> <img src="{% static 'accounts/curriculum/Images/list.png' %}" width="70%" /> </center>
      <!-- Hello image end -->
       
      <p>
      <br> <br> 
      Programmers like to count from 0. Hence, instead of having 1, 2, 3 and, 4 position numbers, we have 0, 1, 2 and, 3 position numbers! <br> <br>
       

      <code>shopping_list = [“carrots", "chocolate", "butter", "bread"]</code> <br> <br>
       
      If we want to print the third item in the shopping_list (butter) we can do so by entering its position in the list <i>(called the index position)</i> inside square brackets ([]), like we did for strings: <br> <br>

      <code> print (shopping_list[2]) </code>

      <br> <br>

      Output: <samp> butter </samp> <br> <br>

      What if we want to print all the elements? <br> <br>

      <code>for x in range(0,4):</code> <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;
      <code>print (shopping_list[x])</code> <br> <br> 

      OR<br><br>

      <code>print shopping_list</code> <br> <br>

       
      Eve forgot to add flour to her list! Oh no, how will she bake cake now? <br>
      But, fear not..you can add flour to her shopping list  since there’s no limit for the length of the shopping list. <br><br>

      Syntax: <br> 
      <code>list_name.append(item)</code> <br> <br>

      <code>shopping_list.append(“flour”)</code> <br> <br>
                 
      Now using append(), the item can only be added to the end of the list. But do not fret, we can add the item to whichever position you like using another function <b>insert()</b>. Eve wants to buys toffees! Let's put toffees after carrots. So we to insert it at index number 1. <br> <br>

      Syntax: <br> 
      <code>list_name.insert(index number, item)</code> <br> <br>
      <code>shopping_list.insert(1,"toffees")</code>  <br><br> 

      Within the brackets first mention the desired  <i>index number</i>  and then the item. <br> <br>

      Sometimes you need to remove something from the list, that can achieved by yet another function <b>remove()</b>. <br>
      Silly Eve forgot she already had a loaf of bread at home, so she needs our help to remove that item from the list.<br> <br>

      Syntax: <br>
      <code>list_name.remove(item)</code> <br><br>

      <code>shopping_list.remove(“bread”)</code><br><br>

      Eve has realised that she doesn't need carrots for baking a cake! She wants to buy eggs now... Easy! Just replace the carrots!! Carrots are on the first position, so their index number is 0.<br><br>

      Syntax:<br>
      <code> list_name[postion_of_the_replacement] = new_value</code><br><br>

      <code> shopping_list[0] = "eggs"</code>

      <br><br>

      Good work! Now Eve can go shopping!!
